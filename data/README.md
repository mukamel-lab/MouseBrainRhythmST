# data/

Keep large datasets **out of git**. Put only small example inputs here.

Subfolders:
- `raw/` raw inputs (normally empty in git)
- `processed/` outputs of preprocessing (normally empty in git)
- `external/` reference files (gene annotations, region labels, etc.)

Add links, access instructions, and checksums for full datasets in this README.
